<h3>Newbury College BLUE Theme - V2.0</h3>
<hr />

<p>Created by Shaun Daubney</p>

<p>This theme is part of a package and is currently the default theme for <a href="http://vle.newbury-college.ac.uk">Newbury College</a>.</p>

<p>All my themes are 'work in progress' and continually under development. If you like this theme and use it yourself, 
let me know what types of modifications you make, I'd love to see them and maybe pinch some ideas for mine.</p>

<p>Thanks for the support in the <a href="http://www.moodle.org">Moodle.org</a> forums, Rachel for putting up with all the 
changes I keep making and Solent Uni for posting an example that solved my CSS menu headache!</p>

<p>This theme is based on Moodle's Standard Theme.  By default, the styles of the Standard theme
are automatically loaded before any other themes, so that all custom themes need to do is to define their
own styles to augment or overwrite particular standard styles.</p>

<p>For this theme to work properly, the Moodle Standard theme must be present 
  and un altered in the Theme directory.</p>

<p>In this way custom themes are not "left behind" by Moodle upgrades.</p>
